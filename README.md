# CS-499-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

This artifact is an OpenGL program that renders a scene of 3D objects, originally created for the CS 330 Computational Graphics and Visualization course.

The project was included in full with the needed libraries in case you
wanted to run the project in this state via Visual Studio. 

You may need to set the paths to the dependencies in the Libraries folder
to do this. I will try to find a better solution to this when I publish
the project.
